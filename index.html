              Ravens are a species of large, black-feathered birds native to
              Westeros. Westerosi ravens are similar to common ravens of Earth,
              only with better homing instincts. Like carrion crows, ravens
              often scavenge from the dead.

              Odin and Thor are Northern Inuit dogs, a crossbreed related to
              Siberian huskies and German shepherds. They played two Game of
              Thrones dire wolf characters as puppies.
